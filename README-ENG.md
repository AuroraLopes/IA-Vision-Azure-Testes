# Project Description: AI Vision Tests on Azure

This project involves the implementation and evaluation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Vision resources using the Azure platform. To kick off, a dedicated resource group was established exclusively for these tests.

### Project Stages:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Creation of a specific resource group.
   - Integration with the Azure Vision platform to leverage its advanced capabilities.

   - **Comment:** *Started by creating a new resource group specifically for these tests.*

2. **Face Detection Test:**
   - Selection of the created resource group.
   - Utilization of the AI-provided face detector.
   - Display of results, including JSON output stored in the "Outputs" folder in the repository.

   - **Comment:** *After creating the group, moved on to Azure Vision, selecting the resource group for face detection testing.*
   - Here, we started the first test:

     **Comment:** *As we can see, the AI easily detected <br /> the face of the woman in the first test image.*

3. **Challenging Detection Positions:**
   - Presentation of a challenging image with a person sideways.
   - Verification of the AI's effectiveness even in challenging facial visibility situations.

   - **Comment:** *However, showing only one face is easy, so I added a slightly more difficult image, where one of the people is sideways and it's not possible to see the face <br /> completely, but I saw that even with this difficulty, the AI did very well!*

4. **Character Detection Test:**
   - Exploration of the character detection feature.
   - Assessment of the AI's ability to recognize characters in a blurred image.

   - **Comment:** *Moved on to the next test, character detection, using directly a challenging and slightly blurred image to test the AI's recognition capabilities.*

5. **Image Description:**
   - Testing the AI's image description feature.
   - Reflection on the obtained results, including hopes for future developments towards more detailed descriptions.

   - **Comment:** *Concluded the tests by evaluating the AI's ability to describe images, expressing some disappointment in the lack of details, and anticipating future improvements.*

### Results and Final Thoughts:

The project highlighted the efficiency of AI Vision on Azure, particularly in face detection even in challenging situations. Additionally, tests on character detection and image description provided valuable insights, acknowledging the potential for continuous improvements in detail provision. The ongoing development of this project is committed to keeping pace with AI technological advancements.
